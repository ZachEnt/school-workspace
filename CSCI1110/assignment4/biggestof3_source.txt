/ Program to take 3 inputs from the user and print out the biggest one.

		/ Take in 3 inputs x, y, and z
		IN x
		IN y
		IN z

		/ Compare x to y, jump away if we find x is less than y
		LOAD x
		COMPARE y
		JUMPLT y>x

		/ x is stil in register, no need to reload it
		/ Compare x to z, jump away if we find x is less than z
x>=y:		COMPARE z
		JUMPLT zbiggest

		/ If we're here, x>=y and x>=z, so output x and quit
xbiggest:	OUT x
		HALT

		/ If we're here, x is out of the running but we still have y and z
		/ Compare y to z, jump away if we find y is less than z
y>x:		LOAD y
		COMPARE z
		JUMPLT zbiggest
