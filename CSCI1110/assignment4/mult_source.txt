/ Program to take in two non-negative integers from the user and multiply them.
/ Note that because we don't have a MULTIPLY operation, we accomplish this via iterated addition.

		/ Get multiplicand and multiplier from user
		IN multiplicand
		IN multiplier

		/ loop while the multiplier > 0
loop:		LOAD multiplier
		COMPARE zero
		JUMPEQ end  / Exit the loop once multiplier = 0
		DECREMENT multiplier / Subtract 1 from multiplier each iteration
		
		/ Add the multiplicand into the product
		LOAD product
		ADD multiplicand
		STORE product
		
		/ End of loop body, repeat
		JUMP loop

		/ Once multiplication is complete, print product and halt
end:		OUT product
		HALT
		



/ Variables
multiplicand:	.DATA 0		/ Number that we'll be adding into product repeatedly
multiplier:	.DATA 0		/ Number of times that the multiplicand will be added into product
product:	.DATA 0
zero:		.DATA 0		/ Need a literal zero defined so we can compare the multiplier to zero
