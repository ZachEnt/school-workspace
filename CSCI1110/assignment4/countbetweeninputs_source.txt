/ Program to count from a first input (inclusive) to a second input (exclusive).
/ Note that this may result in counting either up or down.

		/ Take in the starting and stopping points from the user
		IN curr
		IN target

		/ Each iteration of the loop prints out one number.
loop:		LOAD curr		/ Load the current number into the register
		COMPARE target		/ Compare it to the number we're counting to
		JUMPEQ end		/ If they're now equal (i.e., we've reached the destination), jump to end
		OUT curr		/ Otherwise, print out the current number
		JUMPGT countdown	/ If this number is bigger than the target, we have to count down

		/ If we're still here, we're counting upward
countup:	INCREMENT curr		/ Increase current number by 1
		JUMP loop		/ Repeat the loop, checking if we've reached the destination

		/ If we jumped here, we're counting downward
countdown:	DECREMENT curr		/ Decrease current number by 1
		JUMP loop		/ Repeat the loop, checking if we've reached the destination

end:		HALT			/ Stop execution
